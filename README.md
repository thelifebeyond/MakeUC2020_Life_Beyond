<h1> Life Beyond <h1>
  
How can technology help recently discharged psychiatric mood and substance abuse patients to move past their hospitalization and discover life beyond uncontrolled mental illness?  Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has increased wait times to see an outpatient therapist?

Our team has created a web app to help address this challenge.

Although patients can get excellent care when discharged to a  general outpatient program, they are often overwhelmed and unable to consistently complete the tasks assigned while inpatient to ensure continuity of care.  

Patient and compliance can be low for commonly suggested follow-up actions on the patient's part.  

Some typical assignments include tracking mood daily with rating and number, tracking medication compliance, and writing any medication side effects in the journal.    When patients cannot keep up with their treatment, their conditions worsen, sometimes resulting in re-institutionalization or even death. 

Our app makes it easier for patients to users to track their mood and medicine side effects. We also make it easier to communicate the contents of their daily journal to the therapist. An electronic safety plan has links to resources and allows users to call without dialing during a crisis.
