# Life Beyond
  
How can technology help recently discharged psychiatric mood and substance abuse patients to move past their hospitalization and discover life beyond uncontrolled mental illness?  Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has increased wait times to see an outpatient therapist?

Our team has created a web app to help address this challenge.

Although patients can get excellent care when discharged to a  general outpatient program, they are often overwhelmed and unable to consistently complete the tasks assigned while inpatient to ensure continuity of care.  

Patient and compliance can be low for commonly suggested follow-up actions on the patient's part.  

Some typical assignments include tracking mood daily with rating and number, tracking medication compliance, and writing any medication side effects in the journal.  When patients cannot keep up with their treatment, their conditions worsen, sometimes resulting in re-institutionalization or even death. 

Our app makes it easier for patients to users to track their mood and medicine side effects. We also make it easier to communicate the contents of their daily journal to the therapist. An electronic safety plan has links to resources and allows users to call without dialing during a crisis. 

## Inspiration

Once a patient has completed an inpatient mental health or substance abuse program, their therapist releases them using a "step down" approach to provide the best outcomes. The tiered levels of care are: 

1) **Partial Hospitalization** 
      <ul>
      <li>Do not require 24-hour supervision</li>
      <li>Attend daily therapy</li>
      <li>Reside at home</li>
     </ul>

2) **Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP)** 
      <ul>
      <li>Reside at home</li>
      <li>Attend therapy several times a week</li>
     </ul>

3) **General Outpatient Care (GOC)** 
      <ul>
      <li>Reside at home</li>
      <li>Attend therapy 1x a week or bi-weekly</li>
      <li>See a psychiatrist 1-3x a month</li>
     </ul>

Many patients are released directly from inpatient to GOC because the  "step down" approach can cause financial pressure on a patient because of the high-priced services and the required visitations a patient has to make with their therapist. Because implementing best practices to transition a patient from inpatient to outpatient care where not executed, patients often become overwhelmed and unable to return to normalcy. Everyday tasks such as journaling and tracking mood, medication compliance, side effects, appetite, and sleep become complicated. When patients cannot keep up with their treatment, their conditions worsen, sometimes resulting in re-institutionalization or even death.

The COVID-19 has thrown a monkey wrench into how we function daily and taken many lives and jobs. The "step-down" approach is even harder to implement now because of the layoffs. These difficulties are what inspired the Life Beyond app. 

## What it does

The Life Beyond app will provide patients released from a psychiatric care program the support needed to track and journal their daily living activities. This app will assist patients with their tracking by sending daily email/SMS reminders to them once they transition from inpatient care to outpatient care. The Life Beyond app's tracker will help patients track their everyday mood, medication compliance, side effects, appetite, and sleep. The patient will also have access to a digital copy of their personalized safety plan and a "Call Now" button to give them immediate access to the Suicide Prevention Line. A patient's therapist can quickly pull the data from the backend and provide immediate feedback.

## What's next for Life Beyond

Mental illness affects everyone. We all can identify with the challenges that come with this illness. We may know someone or even struggle with it ourselves. No one should have to feel alone or burden with financial challenges when attempting to cope with everyday living. Life Beyond can be a life-changing application for everyone: patient, family, friends, therapist, and care facilities. We would love to present Life Beyond to psychiatric facilities and help them see the value that we see in it.
